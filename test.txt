Again, I wrote the if, else, and end all at the same time. It really helps
me keep track of “where I am” in the code. It also makes the job seem
easier because I can focus on one small part, such as filling in the code
between the if and the else. The other benefit of doing it this way is that
the computer can understand the program at any stage. Every one of
the unfinished versions of the program I showed you would run. They
weren’t finished, but they were working programs. That way I could
test them as I wrote them, which helped me see how my program was
coming along and where it still needed work. When it passed all the
tests, I knew I was done.
